## Why Adopting the MCH Bridge

The MCH bridge is an application that allows users to upload multiple files to an MCH database such as (stations, station groups, variable station types, and time series). This is a great advantage if the user would want to upload a .csv file containing all the stations or if multiple time series for different variables would want to be upload at once.

The application MCH bridge allows users to upload and preview csv files of:

1. Stations

2. Station Groups

3. Variable Types Stations

4. Time Series (e.g. detail, daily data)

There are two main menus: MCH Database Tables and Data menus

MCH Database Tables Menu provides information about the data in the MCH instance that is connected to the app while the Data menu allows to upload and preview data in each of the MCH tables of the MCH Database Tables Menu.
