## Why Adopting the MCH Bridge

The MCH bridge is an application that allows users to upload multiple files to an MCH database such as (stations, station groups, variable station types, and time series). This is a great advantage if the user woudl want to upload a .csv file containing all the stations or if multiple time sries for different variables woudl wnat to be upload at once.
